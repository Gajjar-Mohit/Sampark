## 💳 Payment Flow Architecture

The system follows a realistic payment ecosystem flow:

```
[BazzarPe] → [PSP: Paisa Vasool Bank] → [NTH] → [PSP: Babu Rao Ganpatrao Bank] → [ChillarPay]
```

**Transaction Journey:**
1. **Initiation**: User initiates payment through TPAP
2. **PSP Processing**: Sponsoring bank validates and processes
3. **Central Routing**: NTH routes transaction to destination PSP
4. **Settlement**: Destination PSP credits beneficiary account
5. **Confirmation**: End-to-end transaction confirmation
