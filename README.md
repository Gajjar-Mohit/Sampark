#### Key Regulatory and Oversight Entities
| Real Name | Dummy Name | Brief Description (for your reference) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| RBI (Reserve Bank of India) | Central Finance Authority (CFA) | The apex regulatory body overseeing monetary policy, licensing, and compliance. In your system, this could be a simulated central node for rules enforcement. |
| NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India) | National Transaction Hub (NTH) | Manages retail payment systems and interoperability. Dummy equivalent acts as a central switch for routing transactions across nodes. |

#### Payment Interfaces and Protocols
| Real Name | Dummy Name | Brief Description (for your reference) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| UPI (Unified Payments Interface) | Integrated Payment Gateway (IPG) | Real-time inter-bank transfer system using proxies like VPAs. In your design, this could be an API layer for seamless P2P/P2M transactions. |
| VPA (Virtual Payment Address) | Proxy Transaction ID (PTID) | Unique identifiers (e.g., user@bank) hiding actual account details. Dummy version enables alias-based addressing in your network. |
| IMPS (Immediate Payment Service) | Instant Funds Relay (IFR) | 24/7 instant transfers via mobile or account numbers. Your dummy could handle low-latency, always-on settlements. |
| NEFT (National Electronic Funds Transfer) | Batch Transfer Network (BTN) | Batched electronic transfers settled in cycles. In your architecture, this might use queued processing for non-real-time ops. |
| RTGS (Real Time Gross Settlement) | High-Value Instant Settlement (HVIS) | Real-time settlement for large-value transactions. Dummy focuses on gross (individual) processing with no netting. |
| AEPS (Aadhaar Enabled Payment System) | Biometric Identity Payment (BIP) | Biometric-authenticated transactions linked to identity. Your version could integrate simulated auth modules like fingerprints. |

#### Supporting Systems and Tools
| Real Name | Dummy Name | Brief Description (for your reference) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| BHIM (Bharat Interface for Money) | Core Payment App (CPA) | Government-backed UPI app for users. In your setup, this is a reference client app interfacing with your IPG (dummy UPI). |
| RuPay | Secure Card Network (SCN) | Domestic card payment network. Dummy could represent a tokenized card system for POS or online payments. |
| PSP (Payment Service Provider) e.g., Google Pay, PhonePe | Transaction Facilitator Service (TFS) | Third-party apps/providers routing user requests. Your dummies (e.g., TFS-Alpha, TFS-Beta) act as edge nodes in a distributed system. |
| QR Code System (in UPI) | Dynamic Scan Code (DSC) | Visual codes for initiating payments. In your design, this could be a module generating scannable payloads with embedded metadata. |
| Central Repository (for logs/audits) | Unified Data Vault (UDV) | Stores transaction history and compliance data. Dummy serves as a centralized (or distributed ledger) database for auditing. |

#### Security and Fraud Components
| Real Name | Dummy Name | Brief Description (for your reference) |
|-----------|------------|---------------------------------------|
| UPI PIN / 2FA | Secure Auth Token (SAT) | Multi-factor authentication for transactions. In your CS-based design, implement as hashed challenges or biometric simulations. |
| Anti-Fraud Monitoring (AI/ML in NPCI) | Risk Detection Engine (RDE) | Real-time anomaly detection. Your dummy could use mock ML models for pattern recognition in transaction flows. |

These dummy names are neutral and scalable, so you can adapt them to your comp sci conceptsâ€”like using microservices for the NTH (NPCI dummy), event-driven architecture for IFR (IMPS), or blockchain-inspired ledgers for UDV. If you provide more details on specific parts of your architecture (e.g., focusing on UPI workflows or adding new features), I can refine these or suggest code snippets/pseudocode for implementation.
