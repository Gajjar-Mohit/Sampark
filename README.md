# SAMPARK: Seamless and Modern Payment Architecture for Rapid Transactions

## Purpose
SAMPARK (Seamless and Modern Payment Architecture for Rapid Transactions) is a proof-of-concept digital payment ecosystem designed to emulate and innovate upon India’s advanced financial infrastructure, such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), using core computer science principles. Launched as an experimental framework on September 04, 2025, SAMPARK aims to deliver a scalable, secure, and interoperable platform for real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) and person-to-merchant (P2M) transactions. By simulating India’s banking systems, it serves as an educational tool for developers and researchers to explore distributed systems, API-driven architectures, and secure transaction processing, while promoting accessible and inclusive digital finance for a connected Bharat.

### Why SAMPARK?
- **Educational Platform**: Enables hands-on learning of real-time transaction systems, microservices, and fraud detection using simulated components inspired by India’s banking ecosystem.
- **Innovation Hub**: Tests advanced fintech features like proxy-based payments (Proxy Transaction ID), biometric authentication, and QR code transactions.
- **Inclusivity**: Supports diverse users, including those using feature phones, via biometric payments and intuitive interfaces.
- **Scalability**: Demonstrates handling high transaction volumes (10,000+ TPS) with distributed system design.
- **Security Focus**: Implements robust authentication and AI-driven fraud detection to ensure trust and compliance.

## Key Components
- **Integrated Payment Gateway (IPG)**: Real-time inter-bank transfers using Proxy Transaction IDs (PTID, e.g., user@bank) for secure P2P/P2M payments.
- **Dynamic Scan Code (DSC)**: Generates/scans QR codes for seamless merchant transactions.
- **Biometric Identity Payment (BIP)**: Identity-based payments using simulated biometric authentication.
- **Instant Funds Relay (IFR)**: 24/7 instant transfers via mobile or account details.
- **Batch Transfer Network (BTN)**: Queued, batched settlements for non-urgent transfers.
- **High-Value Instant Settlement (HVIS)**: Real-time processing for large-value transactions.
- **National Transaction Hub (NTH)**: Centralized switch for interoperable routing across banks.
- **Core Payment App (CPA)**: User-facing app for IPG transactions, PTID creation, and history tracking.
- **Secure Card Network (SCN)**: Domestic card system for POS and online payments.
- **Transaction Facilitator Service (TFS)**: Third-party providers (e.g., TFS-Alpha, TFS-Beta) routing user requests.
- **Unified Data Vault (UDV)**: Stores transaction logs and compliance data.
- **Secure Auth Token (SAT)**: Multi-factor authentication (PIN, biometrics) for transactions.
- **Risk Detection Engine (RDE)**: AI-driven real-time anomaly detection for fraud prevention.

## Project Goals
- **Technical Excellence**: Build a distributed, API-driven system with microservices, achieving <5-second transaction latency for IPG/IFR and 99.99% uptime.
- **Interoperability**: Enable seamless integration with banks and Transaction Facilitator Services (TFS) via National Transaction Hub (NTH).
- **User Reach**: Support 100 million+ users and 1,000+ merchants with user-friendly interfaces like Core Payment App (CPA).
- **Security & Compliance**: Ensure end-to-end encryption, SAT-based authentication, and adherence to Central Finance Authority (CFA) regulations.
- **Scalability**: Handle 1 billion transactions/month within 2 years, showcasing robust architecture.

## Who Is This For?
