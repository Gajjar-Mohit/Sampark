## 🏗️ **System Architecture**

<details>
<summary><strong>🔧 Core Components</strong></summary>

### Payment Processing
- **🔗 Integrated Payment Gateway (IPG)**: Real-time inter-bank transfers using Proxy Transaction IDs (PTID, e.g., user@bank) for secure P2P/P2M payments
- **⚡ Instant Funds Relay (IFR)**: 24/7 instant transfers via mobile or account details
- **💰 High-Value Instant Settlement (HVIS)**: Real-time processing for large-value transactions
- **📦 Batch Transfer Network (BTN)**: Queued, batched settlements for non-urgent transfers

### User Interface & Security
- **📱 Core Payment App (CPA)**: User-facing app for IPG transactions, PTID creation, and history tracking
- **🔐 Secure Auth Token (SAT)**: Multi-factor authentication (PIN, biometrics) for transactions
- **👆 Biometric Identity Payment (BIP)**: Identity-based payments using simulated biometric authentication
- **📋 Dynamic Scan Code (DSC)**: Generates/scans QR codes for seamless merchant transactions

### Infrastructure & Data
- **🌐 National Transaction Hub (NTH)**: Centralized switch for interoperable routing across banks
- **💳 Secure Card Network (SCN)**: Domestic card system for POS and online payments
- **🔄 Transaction Facilitator Service (TFS)**: Third-party providers (e.g., TFS-Alpha, TFS-Beta) routing user requests
- **🗄️ Unified Data Vault (UDV)**: Stores transaction logs and compliance data
- **🛡️ Risk Detection Engine (RDE)**: AI-driven real-time anomaly detection for fraud prevention
